- **📝 Citation Format**: Shows how the assistant provides source attribution
- **🤖 Model Comparison**: Perfect for testing GPT-5 vs GPT-4o research capabilities

### **Expected Behavior:**
1. Assistant analyzes the request and identifies need for both search tools
2. Executes mock document search showing sample technical files
3. Performs mock web search showing current 2025 developments  
4. Synthesizes results into comprehensive analysis with proper citations
5. Displays token usage statistics for performance analysis

### **Testing Instructions:**
- Try with **GPT-5 first** (default) - note depth and style
- Switch to **GPT-4o** and ask the same question
- Compare response quality, token usage, and processing approach
- Check that both search tools activate (🌐 Web + 📚 Document indicators)

## 💬 **Demonstration Prompt #2: Conversational Memory & Context Awareness**

### **The Multi-Turn Conversation:**

**Turn 1:**
```
"Explain quantum computing fundamentals"
```

**Turn 2:** *(After receiving the first response)*
```
"How would I apply that to cryptography?"
```

**Turn 3:** *(After receiving the second response)*
```
"What are the main challenges with implementing this approach?"
```

### **✨ Features Showcased:**
- **🧠 Conversational Memory**: Assistant remembers "that" refers to quantum computing concepts
- **🔄 Context Retention**: Each response builds naturally on previous exchanges
- **💭 Progressive Understanding**: No need to repeat context in follow-up questions
- **🎯 Chat Interface**: Demonstrates smooth conversational flow like Claude.ai
- **📈 Contextual Depth**: Each question explores the topic more deeply
- **💾 Session Persistence**: Chat history maintained throughout the conversation

### **Expected Behavior:**
1. **Turn 1**: Provides comprehensive quantum computing fundamentals
2. **Turn 2**: Seamlessly connects quantum computing to cryptography without re-explanation
3. **Turn 3**: Understands "this approach" refers to quantum cryptography from context
4. Chat history displays all exchanges in clean message bubbles
5. Context maintained across model switches (test by changing models mid-conversation)

### **Testing Instructions:**
- **Complete the full 3-turn sequence** without clearing chat
- Verify each response references previous context appropriately  
- Test **model switching mid-conversation** to see context preservation
- Use **"Clear Chat History"** button in sidebar to reset between tests
- Try variations like "Can you elaborate on the second point you made?"

## 🤖 **Demonstration Prompt #3: Model Comparison & Creative Problem Solving**

### **The Prompt:**
```
"I'm planning a weekend project to build a smart home dashboard. Help me brainstorm innovative features, create a development timeline, and suggest the best technology stack for a beginner."
```

### **✨ Features Showcased:**
- **🎨 Creative Brainstorming**: Demonstrates each model's creative thinking capabilities
- **📋 Structured Planning**: Shows ability to organize complex project information
- **🔀 Model Comparison**: Perfect prompt for side-by-side GPT-5 vs GPT-4o testing
- **🛠️ Problem Solving**: Practical, actionable advice generation
- **👤 Personalization**: Tailored responses based on "beginner" skill level specification
- **⚡ Performance Analysis**: Compare response times and token efficiency between models

### **Expected Behavior:**
1. **Creative Features**: Innovative smart home dashboard ideas
2. **Timeline Creation**: Structured development plan with phases
3. **Technology Recommendations**: Beginner-friendly tech stack suggestions
4. **Practical Focus**: Actionable advice rather than theoretical concepts
5. **Personalized Guidance**: Appropriate complexity level for stated skill level

### **Comparison Testing Protocol:**

#### **Step 1: GPT-5 Baseline**
1. Select **GPT-5** from model dropdown
2. Ask the smart home dashboard question
3. Note response time, creativity level, and structure
4. Record token usage from "📊 Usage Stats"

#### **Step 2: GPT-4o Comparison**  
1. Switch to **GPT-4o** using dropdown
2. Click **"🗑️ Clear Chat History"** in sidebar
3. Ask the exact same question
4. Compare response style, speed, and practicality
5. Record token usage for efficiency comparison

#### **Step 3: Analysis Points**
- **Creativity Level**: Which model provides more innovative ideas?
- **Practicality**: Which gives more actionable advice?
- **Organization**: Which structures information better?
- **Beginner Focus**: Which better addresses skill level requirements?
- **Efficiency**: Token usage and response speed comparison
