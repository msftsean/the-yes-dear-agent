# 🔧 Final Fix: Agent Status Updates on Every Query

## Date: October 13, 2025 - Final Update

---

## ✅ Latest Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Clear Agent Messages on Each Query
**Problem:** Agent messages accumulated and never reset, making the sidebar cluttered.

**Solution:** Clear `shared_memory.agent_messages = []` at the start of each query in Coordinator.

**Code:**
```python
# In CoordinatorExecutor.handle()
def handle(self, message, ctx):
    shared_memory = get_shared_memory()
    
    # Clear old agent messages to start fresh
    shared_memory.agent_messages = []
    
    # Reset all agents...
```

**Result:** Recent Activity section now shows only messages from current query.

### Fix 2: Added Visual Indicator
**Change:** Added "(Resets on new query)" caption under Recent Activity heading.

**UI Update:**
```
📡 Recent Activity:
(Resets on new query)
```

This tells users the messages will clear with each new query.

### Fix 3: Ensure Fresh Workflow Creation
**Change:** Get fresh `shared_memory` reference before creating workflow.

**Code:**
```python
if prompt := st.chat_input("What's on your honeydew list today?"):
    # Get fresh shared memory
    shared_memory = get_shared_memory()
    
    # Create fresh workflow
    workflow = create_multi_agent_workflow(use_real_apis=use_real_apis)
```

## 🧪 Testing Tools Created

### Tool 1: Comprehensive Automated Test
**File:** `week3/test_agent_status.py`

**What it does:**
- Automatically submits 3 queries
- Validates timestamps update
- Checks 12-hour format
- Verifies Eastern timezone
- Detects caching issues
- Creates 4 screenshots

**Run:**
```bash
cd /c/Users/segayle/repos/lo
/c/Users/segayle/repos/lo/env/Scripts/python week3/test_agent_status.py
```

### Tool 2: Manual Guided Test
**File:** `week3/manual_test.py`

**What it does:**
- Opens browser for you
- Guides you step-by-step
- Waits for your input at each step
- Compares sidebar content between queries
- Takes screenshots for comparison
- Tells you exactly what to watch for

**Run:**
```bash
cd /c/Users/segayle/repos/lo
/c/Users/segayle/repos/lo/env/Scripts/python week3/manual_test.py
```

**This is the BEST way to verify the fix!**

## 🎯 Expected Behavior Now

### First Query: "Find information about vacation policy"

**Agent Status:**
```
🤖 Agent Status
🎯 Coordinator: Analyzing [02:45:12 PM]
🌐 Research: Idle
📚 Document: Idle
📝 Summarizer: Idle
```

Then updates to:
```
🎯 Coordinator: Complete [02:45:12 PM]
🌐 Research: Skipped [02:45:13 PM]
📚 Document: Complete [02:45:16 PM]
📝 Summarizer: Complete [02:45:19 PM]
```

**Recent Activity:**
```
📡 Recent Activity:
(Resets on new query)

[02:45:12] Coordinator: Analyzing: Find information...
[02:45:13] Coordinator: Routing - Web: False, Docs: ...
[02:45:14] Document: Searching documents for: Find...
[02:45:16] Document: Found documents
[02:45:19] Summarizer: Synthesizing findings
```

### Second Query: "How many vacation days do I get?"

**What Should Happen:**
1. ✅ **Recent Activity clears** (messages from query 1 disappear)
2. ✅ **New messages appear** for query 2
3. ✅ **Timestamps update** to NEW values (e.g., 02:46:xx PM)
4. ✅ **States cycle** through Idle → Active → Complete again

**Agent Status (NEW timestamps):**
```
🤖 Agent Status
🎯 Coordinator: Complete [02:46:22 PM]  ← NEW!
🌐 Research: Skipped [02:46:23 PM]      ← NEW!
📚 Document: Complete [02:46:26 PM]     ← NEW!
📝 Summarizer: Complete [02:46:29 PM]   ← NEW!
```

**Recent Activity (NEW messages):**
```
📡 Recent Activity:
(Resets on new query)

[02:46:22] Coordinator: Analyzing: How many...    ← NEW!
[02:46:23] Coordinator: Routing - Web: False...  ← NEW!
[02:46:24] Document: Searching documents for...  ← NEW!
[02:46:26] Document: Found documents              ← NEW!
[02:46:29] Summarizer: Synthesizing findings     ← NEW!
```

### Third Query: "Can I carry over vacation days?"

**Should continue updating with fresh timestamps and messages!**

---

## 🧪 How to Test

### Option A: Automated Test (Quick)
```bash
cd /c/Users/segayle/repos/lo
/c/Users/segayle/repos/lo/env/Scripts/python week3/test_agent_status.py
```

**Wait 30 seconds**, then check:
- `week3/test_1_initial_state.png`
- `week3/test_2_first_query.png`
- `week3/test_3_second_query.png`
- `week3/test_4_third_query.png`

Compare the timestamps and messages in each screenshot.

### Option B: Manual Test (Thorough) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
```bash
cd /c/Users/segayle/repos/lo
/c/Users/segayle/repos/lo/env/Scripts/python week3/manual_test.py
```

**Follow the prompts:**
1. Check initial state
2. Enable Real APIs
3. Submit query 1 and observe
4. Submit query 2 and compare
5. Submit query 3 and verify persistence

**The script will guide you and take screenshots!**

### Option C: Pure Manual (Simplest)

1. Open http://localhost:8503
2. Enable "Use Real APIs"
3. Submit: "Find vacation policy"
4. **Note the timestamps** (e.g., 02:45:xx PM)
5. Submit: "How many days?"
6. **Check if timestamps changed** (e.g., 02:46:xx PM)
7. Submit: "Carry over days?"
8. **Verify still updating**

## 🐛 Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue: Streamlit keeps reloading
**Cause:** File watching during development
**Workaround:** After changes, restart app once manually

### Issue: First update works, subsequent fail
**Debugging steps:**
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Look for Python exceptions in terminal
3. Try "Reset System" button in sidebar
4. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Issue: Timestamps same across queries
**This means the fix isn't working:**
1. Verify app restarted after code changes
2. Check `shared_memory.agent_messages = []` line exists in Coordinator
3. Ensure `get_shared_memory()` called in each agent
