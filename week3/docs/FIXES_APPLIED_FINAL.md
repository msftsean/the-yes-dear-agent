# 🔧 Agent Status Issues - FIXES APPLIED

## Date: October 13, 2025

---

## 🐛 Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Worked Once, Then Gave Up
**Problem:** Agent status updates appeared on first query but then stopped updating on subsequent queries.

**Root Cause:** Shared memory reference was being cached in agent executors. Each agent was using a stale reference to `shared_memory` that was captured at initialization time, not the live session_state version.

### Issue 2: Subsequent Searches Show No Status Updates
**Problem:** After the first query completed, subsequent queries showed no agent status changes.

**Root Cause:** Agent states were never reset back to "Idle" after completion, so the UI showed stale "Complete" states and new updates weren't visible.

### Issue 3: 24-Hour Format Instead of 12-Hour
**Problem:** Timestamps displayed as `14:35:22` instead of `02:35:22 PM`

**Root Cause:** Using `strftime('%H:%M:%S')` which is 24-hour format instead of `strftime('%I:%M:%S %p')` for 12-hour with AM/PM.

### Issue 4: No Eastern Time Zone
**Problem:** Timestamps were in UTC or local machine time, not Eastern time.

**Root Cause:** No timezone conversion applied to datetime objects.

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Fresh Shared Memory References
**Changed:** Each agent now calls `get_shared_memory()` at the start of their handler to get a fresh reference from `st.session_state`.

**Code Change:**
```python
# OLD - Stale reference
async def handle(self, routing, ctx):
    shared_memory.update_agent_state(...)  # Uses cached module-level variable

# NEW - Fresh reference
async def handle(self, routing, ctx):
    shared_memory = get_shared_memory()  # Gets live session_state version
    shared_memory.update_agent_state(...)
```

**Applied to:**
- ✅ Coordinator agent
- ✅ Research agent
- ✅ Document agent
- ✅ Summarizer agent

### Fix 2: Reset Agent States on New Query
**Changed:** Coordinator agent now resets all agent states to "Idle" at the start of each query, allowing fresh updates to be visible.

**Code Change:**
```python
async def handle(self, message, ctx):
    # Reset all agents to Idle for fresh start
    shared_memory = get_shared_memory()
    shared_memory.update_agent_state('coordinator', 'Analyzing')
    shared_memory.update_agent_state('research', 'Idle')
    shared_memory.update_agent_state('document', 'Idle')
    shared_memory.update_agent_state('summarizer', 'Idle')
    # ... continue with analysis
```

**Result:** Each query starts with a clean slate, and status updates are visible every time.

### Fix 3: 12-Hour Time Format with AM/PM
**Changed:** Updated `update_agent_state()` method to use 12-hour format.

**Code Change:**
```python
# OLD
self.agent_state_timestamps[agent] = datetime.now().strftime('%H:%M:%S')
# Result: "14:35:22"

# NEW  
eastern_time = datetime.now(eastern)
self.agent_state_timestamps[agent] = eastern_time.strftime('%I:%M:%S %p')
# Result: "02:35:22 PM"
```

**Format Details:**
- `%I` - Hour in 12-hour format (01-12)
- `%M` - Minute (00-59)
- `%S` - Second (00-59)
- `%p` - AM/PM indicator

### Fix 4: Eastern Time Zone Support
**Changed:** Added `pytz` library and timezone conversion to Eastern time.

**Code Change:**
```python
def update_agent_state(self, agent: str, state: str):
    """Update agent state with timestamp in 12-hour Eastern time format"""
    import pytz
    eastern = pytz.timezone('US/Eastern')
    eastern_time = datetime.now(eastern)
    self.agent_states[agent] = state
    self.agent_state_timestamps[agent] = eastern_time.strftime('%I:%M:%S %p')
```

**Dependencies Added:**
- `pytz` - Python timezone library

## 🧪 Comprehensive Test Script

**File:** `week3/test_agent_status.py`

**Tests:**
1. ✅ Initial agent status display
2. ✅ First query updates with timestamps
3. ✅ **Second query continues updating (no caching)**
4. ✅ **Third query still updates (persistence test)**
5. ✅ Timestamps in 12-hour format (HH:MM:SS AM/PM)
6. ✅ Timestamps in Eastern time zone
7. ✅ Recent Activity messages persist and update

**Run Test:**
```bash
cd /c/Users/segayle/repos/lo
/c/Users/segayle/repos/lo/env/Scripts/python week3/test_agent_status.py
```

**Test Output:**
- Creates 4 screenshots showing progression
- Validates timestamp format
- Checks for caching issues
- Verifies continuous updates

## 📊 Expected Behavior Now

### First Query
```
🤖 Agent Status
🎯 Coordinator: Analyzing [02:34:56 PM]
🌐 Research: Idle
📚 Document: Idle
📝 Summarizer: Idle
```

Then updates to:
```
🎯 Coordinator: Complete [02:34:56 PM]
🌐 Research: Skipped [02:34:57 PM]
📚 Document: Searching [02:34:58 PM]
📝 Summarizer: Idle
```

Finally:
```
🎯 Coordinator: Complete [02:34:56 PM]
🌐 Research: Skipped [02:34:57 PM]
📚 Document: Complete [02:35:01 PM]
📝 Summarizer: Complete [02:35:04 PM]
```

### Second Query (NEW BEHAVIOR)
States reset and update again:
```
🎯 Coordinator: Analyzing [02:36:12 PM]  ← NEW timestamp!
🌐 Research: Idle
📚 Document: Idle  
📝 Summarizer: Idle
```

Then:
```
🎯 Coordinator: Complete [02:36:12 PM]
🌐 Research: Skipped [02:36:13 PM]
📚 Document: Searching [02:36:14 PM]  ← NEW timestamp!
📝 Summarizer: Idle
```

**Key Differences:**
- ✅ Timestamps are NEW (not cached)
- ✅ States reset to Idle before updating
- ✅ 12-hour format with AM/PM
- ✅ Eastern time zone

## 🔍 How to Verify Fixes

### Manual Test Steps:

1. **Open app:** http://localhost:8503

2. **Enable Real APIs** in sidebar

3. **Submit first query:**
   ```
   Find information about vacation policy
   ```

4. **Watch Agent Status section** - should see:
   - States changing: Idle → Analyzing/Searching → Complete
   - Timestamps in format: `02:35:22 PM`
   - All 4 agents updating

5. **Submit second query:**
   ```
   How many vacation days do I get?
   ```

6. **Verify updates continue:**
   - ✅ Timestamps change to NEW values
   - ✅ States reset to Idle then update again
   - ✅ Format still 12-hour with AM/PM

7. **Submit third query:**
   ```
   Can I carry over vacation days?
   ```

8. **Verify persistence:**
   - ✅ Still updating on third query
   - ✅ No caching issues
   - ✅ Continuous updates

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Restart app** (already done):
   ```bash
   http://localhost:8503
   ```

2. **Run comprehensive test** (optional):
   ```bash
   cd /c/Users/segayle/repos/lo
   /c/Users/segayle/repos/lo/env/Scripts/python week3/test_agent_status.py
   ```

3. **Manual testing:**
   - Submit 3 different queries
   - Verify timestamps update each time
   - Check 12-hour format with AM/PM
   - Confirm Eastern time zone

4. **Capture screenshots** for demo:
   - Initial state (all Idle)
   - First query (with timestamps)
   - Second query (with NEW timestamps)
   - Third query (showing persistence)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If timestamps still don't update:
```bash
# Hard refresh browser
Ctrl + Shift + R

# Clear session state
Click "🔄 Reset System" in sidebar
```

### If format is still 24-hour:
```bash
# Check pytz is installed
pip list | grep pytz

# Reinstall if needed
pip install pytz
```

### If time zone is wrong:
```python
# Verify in Python console
import pytz
from datetime import datetime
eastern = pytz.timezone('US/Eastern')
print(datetime.now(eastern).strftime('%I:%M:%S %p'))
```
