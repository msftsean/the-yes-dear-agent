## 🎙️ SEGMENT 1: Introduction (0:00-0:30)

### 📹 Visual: Title Screen → Streamlit App

### 🗣️ Script:

> "Hi! I'm presenting my Week 3 assignment: a multi-agent system called 'Yes Dear' - your AI-powered honeydew list assistant."
>
> "This system uses **Microsoft Agent Framework** to orchestrate **4 specialized agents** that collaborate through **shared memory** to handle tasks like research, document search, and information synthesis."
>
> "Let me show you how it works."

### 💡 On-Screen Text:
```
✅ 4 Specialized Agents
✅ Sequential + Parallel Pattern
✅ Shared Memory System
✅ Robust Error Handling
```

## 🎙️ SEGMENT 2: Architecture Walkthrough (0:30-1:30)

### 📹 Visual: Architecture diagram or sidebar info

### 🗣️ Script:

> "The architecture follows a **sequential pattern** with 4 agents:"
>
> "**1. Coordinator Agent** - Analyzes your request and determines which agents are needed. It's the orchestrator."
>
> "**2. Research Agent** - Handles web searches using Google Custom Search API, with automatic fallback to mock data for demos."
>
> "**3. Document Agent** - Searches our internal knowledge base using Pinecone vector search. We've seeded it with company policies and documentation."
>
> "**4. Summarizer Agent** - Takes all findings and synthesizes them into a comprehensive response using GPT-4o."
>
> "All agents communicate through a **SharedMemory class** that maintains state, logs activity, and enables collaboration."

### 📹 Show: Sidebar with Architecture section expanded

### 💡 Point Out:
- Icons for each agent (🎯 🌐 📚 📝)
- Sequential flow diagram
- "Shared Memory: Active" indicator

---

## 🎙️ SEGMENT 3: Live Demonstration (1:30-3:30)

### 📹 Visual: Main chat interface

### 🗣️ Script - Part A: First Query (1:30-2:30)

> "Let's see it in action. I'm using **Demo Mode** which uses mock data for reliable demonstrations."
>
> "I'll ask: **'Tell me about our company's vacation policy'**"

### 📹 Actions:
1. Type the query
2. Press Enter
3. **Watch the status indicator** - "🤖 Multi-agent system processing..."

### 🗣️ Narration while processing:

> "Watch what happens behind the scenes:"
>
> "The **Coordinator** is analyzing the request... it detects keywords like 'policy' and 'company', so it knows to search documents first."
>
> "The **Research Agent** is searching the web for additional context..."
>
> "The **Document Agent** is querying our Pinecone knowledge base... it found our Vacation Policy 2024 document!"
>
> "Now the **Summarizer** is combining both results into a coherent answer..."

### 📹 Show: Click "📊 Agent Execution Details" expander

### 🗣️ Narration:

> "Here's proof all agents executed successfully:"

### 📹 Highlight:
- ✅ Coordinator: Complete [timestamp]
- ✅ Research: Complete [timestamp]  
- ✅ Document: Complete [timestamp]
- ✅ Summarizer: Complete [timestamp]

### 🗣️ Script - Part B: Second Query (2:30-3:00)

> "Let's try a more complex query: **'Research electric vehicles and find our vehicle reimbursement policy'**"
>
> "This requires BOTH web research AND document search - demonstrating how agents work in parallel."

### 📹 Actions:
1. Type query
2. Show processing
3. Expand execution details again

### 🗣️ Narration:

> "Notice the timestamps - Research and Document agents ran in parallel to reduce latency."
>
> "The activity log shows every step: routing decisions, search queries, synthesis process."

### 📹 Show: Scroll through Activity Log in the expander

---

## 🎙️ SEGMENT 4: Technical Deep Dive (3:30-4:30)

### 📹 Visual: Split screen - app + code editor

### 🗣️ Script:

> "Now let me show you the key technical implementations."

### 📹 Show: SharedMemory class code (lines 44-91)

### 🗣️ Narration:

> "**Shared Memory**: This class acts as the brain - storing search results, agent messages, and maintaining state across the workflow."

### 📹 Show: ResearchExecutor with error handling (lines ~360-400)

### 🗣️ Narration:

> "**Error Handling**: Every agent has a 3-tier fallback system:"
>
> "Tier 1: Real API call - best quality"
> "Tier 2: Mock data fallback - guaranteed to work"  
> "Tier 3: Skip gracefully - workflow continues"
>
> "This means the system NEVER crashes, even with missing API keys or network failures."

### 📹 Show: Switch to "Use Real APIs" checkbox

### 🗣️ Narration:

> "I can toggle to Real Mode for production use with actual Google Search and Pinecone, but Demo Mode ensures reliable presentations."

### 📹 Demonstrate: Toggle checkbox (don't actually test - just show the option)

## 🎙️ SEGMENT 5: Conclusion (4:30-5:00)

### 📹 Visual: Return to app, show completed queries

### 🗣️ Script:

> "To summarize what we've built:"
>
> "✅ **4 specialized agents** working together seamlessly"
> "✅ **Sequential workflow pattern** with parallel execution capability"
> "✅ **Shared memory system** enabling effective collaboration"
> "✅ **Comprehensive error handling** with 3-tier fallbacks"
> "✅ **Production-ready architecture** using Microsoft Agent Framework"
