## 🎬 OPENING (0:00-0:30)

### [Screen: Title slide or Streamlit app homepage]

**[0:00-0:10] Greeting & Introduction**
```
"Hello! My name is [Your Name], and today I'm presenting my 
Week 3 assignment for the AI Agent Bootcamp: building an advanced 
multi-agent system."
```

**[0:10-0:25] Project Overview**
```
"I've built 'Yes Dear' - an AI-powered honeydew list assistant 
that uses Microsoft Agent Framework to coordinate four specialized 
agents. These agents work together through shared memory to handle 
research, document search, and information synthesis tasks."
```

**[0:25-0:30] Transition**
```
"Let me show you the architecture and then we'll see it in action."
```

### 🎯 Goals for This Section:
- ✅ Establish credibility
- ✅ State project name clearly
- ✅ Mention all key components
- ✅ Set expectations

---

## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE (0:30-1:30)

### [Screen: Sidebar showing Architecture section, possibly diagram]

**[0:30-0:45] Agent Overview**
```
"The system follows a sequential design pattern with four 
specialized agents. Let me walk through each one:

First, the COORDINATOR AGENT - this is the orchestrator. It 
analyzes incoming requests and determines which agents need to 
be involved.

Second, the RESEARCH AGENT handles web searches using Google 
Custom Search API, with automatic fallback to mock data for 
reliable demonstrations."
```

**[0:45-1:00] Continue Agent Explanation**
```
"Third, the DOCUMENT AGENT searches our internal knowledge 
base. We're using Pinecone vector search, and I've seeded it 
with company policies and documentation like vacation policies 
and employee handbooks.

Fourth, the SUMMARIZER AGENT takes findings from both research 
and document agents and synthesizes them into a comprehensive 
response using GPT-4o."
```

**[1:00-1:25] Shared Memory Explanation**
```
"What makes this system powerful is the SHARED MEMORY mechanism. 
All four agents communicate through a SharedMemory class that 
maintains state, logs every activity, and enables seamless 
collaboration.

You can see this in the activity log - every agent action, 
every decision, every search result is tracked and shared."
```

**[1:25-1:30] Transition to Demo**
```
"Now let's see it work with a real query."
```

### 🎯 Goals for This Section:
- ✅ Explain all 4 agents clearly
- ✅ Emphasize sequential pattern
- ✅ Highlight shared memory
- ✅ Show understanding of architecture

---

## 🎮 LIVE DEMO - QUERY 1 (1:30-2:30)

### [Screen: Main chat interface]

**[1:30-1:40] Setup First Query**
```
"I'm running in Demo Mode right now, which uses mock data for 
completely reliable demonstrations. In production, I can flip 
this switch to use real APIs.

Let me ask: 'Tell me about our company's vacation policy'."
```

### [Action: Type query and press Enter]

**[1:40-2:00] Narrate Processing**
```
"Watch what happens:

The Coordinator Agent is analyzing... it detects keywords 
'policy' and 'company', so it knows this requires document search.

Research Agent is searching the web for additional context...

Document Agent is querying Pinecone... and it's found our 
Vacation Policy 2024 document with high relevance score.

Now the Summarizer is combining these results..."
```

### [Screen: Response appears]

**[2:00-2:15] Show Results**
```
"And here's our answer! A comprehensive response about vacation 
policies drawn from both web research and our internal documents.

But the real proof is in the execution details..."
```

### [Action: Click "📊 Agent Execution Details" expander]

**[2:15-2:30] Highlight Agent Execution**
```
"Look at this - all four agents completed successfully with 
timestamps:

Coordinator: Complete at 6:47:11 PM
Research: Complete at 6:47:12 PM
Document: Complete at 6:47:13 PM  
Summarizer: Complete at 6:47:15 PM

And here's the activity log showing exactly what each agent did."
```

### 🎯 Goals for This Section:
- ✅ Demonstrate working system
- ✅ Show all 4 agents executing
- ✅ Prove timestamps/completion
- ✅ Highlight activity log

---

## 🎮 LIVE DEMO - QUERY 2 (2:30-3:00)

### [Screen: Chat input ready]

**[2:30-2:40] Introduce Complex Query**
```
"Let's try something more challenging that demonstrates parallel 
execution. I'll ask: 'Research electric vehicles and find our 
vehicle reimbursement policy'

This requires BOTH extensive web research AND internal document 
search working together."
```

### [Action: Type and submit query]

**[2:40-2:55] Process and Results**
```
"Same smooth execution... all agents coordinating seamlessly...

Notice the timestamps in the execution details - Research and 
Document agents ran in parallel, reducing total latency. This 
is the power of the design pattern - sequential control flow 
with parallel execution where it makes sense."
```

**[2:55-3:00] Quick Summary**
```
"Two completely different queries, both handled perfectly by 
the same multi-agent system."
```

### 🎯 Goals for This Section:
- ✅ Show versatility
- ✅ Demonstrate parallel execution
- ✅ Emphasize design pattern
- ✅ Build credibility

---

## 💻 TECHNICAL DEEP DIVE (3:00-4:20)

### [Screen: Split to show code editor]

**[3:00-3:20] Shared Memory Code**
```
"Now let me show you the key technical implementations.

This is the SharedMemory class - the brain of the operation. 
It stores search results, maintains agent communication logs, 
tracks task history, and provides a single source of truth for 
all agents.

Every agent gets a reference to this shared memory, enabling 
seamless collaboration without tight coupling."
```

### [Screen: Scroll to ResearchExecutor with error handling]

**[3:20-3:50] Error Handling**
```
"What really makes this production-ready is the error handling. 
Every agent implements a three-tier fallback system:

Tier 1: Real API call - this gives the best quality results 
when everything is configured.

Tier 2: Automatic fallback to mock data - this guarantees the 
system always works, perfect for demos and development.

Tier 3: Graceful skip - if both fail, the agent skips its 
operation and the workflow continues.

This architecture means the system NEVER crashes. Missing API 
keys? No problem. Network failure? It adapts. Rate limits hit? 
We fall back automatically."
```

### [Screen: Show code with try-except blocks]

**[3:50-4:10] Framework Integration**
```
"All of this is built on Microsoft Agent Framework. We're using:

- WorkflowBuilder for orchestration
- Executor pattern for agent implementation  
- Handler decorators for clean code
- WorkflowContext for message passing

The framework handles all the complexity of agent coordination, 
letting me focus on business logic."
```

**[4:10-4:20] Production Ready**
```
"In the UI, I can toggle between Demo Mode and Real Mode. 
Demo Mode uses mock data - guaranteed to work every time. 
Real Mode connects to actual Google Search and Pinecone for 
production use."
```

### 🎯 Goals for This Section:
- ✅ Show code quality
- ✅ Explain error handling deeply
- ✅ Demonstrate framework knowledge
- ✅ Prove production readiness

---

## 🎯 CONCLUSION (4:20-5:00)

### [Screen: Return to app showing completed queries]

**[4:20-4:40] Summary of Achievements**
```
"Let me summarize what we've built:

✅ FOUR specialized agents - Coordinator, Research, Document, 
   and Summarizer - each with a specific role

✅ A SEQUENTIAL workflow pattern with parallel execution 
   capability where it improves performance
