## 🐛 Troubleshooting

2. Check API Status shows "✅ APIs Ready"
3. Look for "Real API" in System Logs
4. Refresh browser page (Ctrl+R)

### Issue: No results found

**Solution:**
1. Wait 30 seconds after seeding (indexing lag)
2. Try exact query: "vacation policy"
3. Check Pinecone API key in .env file
4. Re-run: `python week3/seed_and_test_pinecone.py`

### Issue: Low match scores (<0.70)

**Cause:** Query may be too vague or off-topic
**Solution:** Use more specific queries about vacation/HR topics

### Issue: Error connecting to Pinecone

**Solution:**
1. Verify PINECONE_API_KEY in .env file
2. Check internet connection
3. Verify Pinecone index exists: `python week3/quick_seed.py`
