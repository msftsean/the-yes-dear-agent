## 💡 Pro Testing Tips

### Tip 1: Always Start in Demo Mode
- Keep "Use Real APIs" **UNCHECKED**
- Mock data is reliable and fast
- No API failures to worry about
- Perfect for testing logic

### Tip 2: Test Progressive Complexity
```
Simple   →  Medium  →  Complex
"AI news"  "Research AI"  "Research AI and check docs"
```

### Tip 3: Watch Multiple Indicators
- ✅ Agent Status Panel (shows activity)
- ✅ Workflow Visualization (shows flow)
- ✅ Shared Memory (shows data)
- ✅ Agent Messages (shows communication)
- ✅ System Logs (shows errors)

### Tip 4: Screenshot Key Moments
1. All agents showing in status
2. Parallel execution with timestamps
3. Workflow visualization
4. Shared memory with data
5. Final response with citations

### Tip 5: Document As You Test
Use the test results template in TESTING_SCRIPT.md:
```markdown
Test 1 (Research Only):     ✅ Passed
Test 2 (Document Only):     ✅ Passed
Test 3 (Both Parallel):     ✅ Passed
...
```
