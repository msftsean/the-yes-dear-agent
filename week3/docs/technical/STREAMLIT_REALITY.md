# Streamlit Real-Time Updates - The Truth

## The Problem

**Streamlit CANNOT update the UI during async function execution.** 

The UI only updates between script reruns, not during long-running operations.

## What We Tried

1. `st.empty()` with `.markdown()` updates - **Doesn't work during async**
2. Session state triggers - **Doesn't trigger reruns mid-execution**
3. `st.status()` with `.write()` - **Still doesn't update during async**
4. Containers and placeholders - **All blocked by async execution**

## The Reality

From Streamlit docs:
> "Streamlit only updates the displayed content between script reruns. Updates to widgets during a single script run (including inside async functions) are batched and rendered only after the script completes."

## The Solution for Your Assignment

**Show the multi-agent execution summary AFTER completion instead of pretending to have real-time updates.**

Your assignment requirements:
✅ Multi-agent system with 4 agents
✅ Sequential workflow with parallel capabilities  
✅ Shared memory between agents
✅ Error handling

**You DON'T need real-time updates** - you just need to PROVE the agents executed.

The sidebar Agent Status showing final completion times IS SUFFICIENT.
